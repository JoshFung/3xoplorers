# 3xoplorers - Entry for 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge

> Challenge: Chronicles of Exoplanet Exploration

## Overview

**3xoplorer** is a game designed to teach younger audiences about the methods used to discover exoplanets, focusing on the *transit* and *direct imaging* methods. Our minigames were carefully crafted to simplify the discovery processes, giving players a fun and interactive hands-on learning experience. The ultimate goal is for *3xoplorers* to find its way into classrooms, helping younger students explore the universe in a way that feels less like homework and more like an adventure!

## How to Play 3xoplorers
### Controls
To control your character, use the arrow keys. Inside your spaceship, the arrow keys will be used to navigate to the interactive control panels, which play your educational minigames! While playing the minigames, the arrow keys will only be used for selection, and the interaction keys are `z` and `x`. Additionally, all controls are thoroughly explained before minigames start.

In summary:
- Movement using arrow keys.
- Interaction keys using `z` and `x`.

## Progression
Once you have launched 3xoplorers, your first mission is to complete the first minigame! Our minigames are designed to teach the audience different methods of discovering exoplanets and are accessible on the spaceship.

### Minigames

#### 1) Finding Stars with Exoplanets using the Transit method

Your first job as the rover is to use the **transit** method to identify stars with exoplanets! Each star will blink at different frequencies, however, only those with exoplanets will blink at a *consistent rate*!

#### 2) Finding Exoplanets using the Direct Imaging method

Your second job as the rover is to use the **direct imaging** method to photograph exoplanets. Exoplanets are more visible when there is less light interference, so you need to take a photograph when an astroid is passing over the star you are observing.
