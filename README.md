## How to Play 3x0Plorers
### Controls
To control your character, use the arrow keys. Inside your spaceship, the arrow keys will be used to navigate to the interactive control panels, which play your educational minigames! While playing the minigames, the arrow keys will only be used for selection, and interaction keys are `z` and `x`. Additionally, all controls are thoroughly explained before minigames start.

In summary:
- Movement using arrow keys.
- Interaction keys using `z` and `x`.

## Progression
Once you have launched 3x0Plorers, your first mission is to complete the first minigame! Our minigames are designed to teach the audience different methods of discovering exoplanets and are accessible on the spaceship.
